# Start

Hey! Welcome to my project, here you'll find a quck documentation to get access to my program, have fun!

# Documentation

To gain acces to my program you first need to clone the repository.

After starting Docker log in into Postman and localhost with one of these users:

## Admin

username: user

password: Uek295



## User

username: user2

password: Uek295_2


## After login

now you need to run the program on intelliJ.

[Here](http://localhost:8080/rank)  you can access the localhost and [here](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/rank-controller/) you can find my swagger documentation.

Thank you for using my program and have fun with it!
